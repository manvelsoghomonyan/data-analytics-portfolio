                        <p>
                            This report delivers a comprehensive analysis of employee
                            attrition, uncovering the reasons behind turnover and proposing

                        <li>Analyze the root causes of employee attrition through statistical methods and employee feedback.</li>
                        <li>Identify departments, roles, and employee demographics most impacted by attrition.</li>

                        <p>
                            The analysis segmented employees based on department, job role, and tenure,
                            uncovering attrition trends and temporal patterns. By calculating attrition
                            rates and employing statistical methods, the report identified critical factors
                            contributing to turnover. Insights revealed were instrumental in guiding
                            strategies to improve employee satisfaction, stabilize retention, and drive
                            organizational growth.
